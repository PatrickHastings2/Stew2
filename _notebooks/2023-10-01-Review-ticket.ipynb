    "## Recap\n",
    "This week's preparation for the basics test provided valuable insights into utilizing `console.log` effectively and understanding the expected console outputs. Additionally, I gained knowledge on how to incorporate attributes for adding colors, images, and buttons within my HTML code cells.\n",

    "# Challenges Faced\n",
    "I encountered some difficulties in grasping the purpose of `console.log` commands initially. However, I realized that viewing the output in the console, rather than in VSCode, allowed me to observe the results generated by my code. This insight was crucial in understanding why my code cells didn't display any output when executed.\n",
