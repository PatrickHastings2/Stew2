    "As I completed the exam I took note psuedo codes similarity to python, and that it seems to be sort of infomral way of representing python through the human thought process. Additionally, psuedo code serves as a way to plan out and orgainze your code before you actually scripting it, as a result, I don't believe that Psuedo code is necessarily used to represent python only, but other programming languages.
