During my second week in CSP I learned the basics of python and its capabilities. I cretaed and Html table, learned some python tricks (How to use Emojis), and added the snake game to my notebook. I fell into some trouble when I noticed that my html table looked imcomplete on my blog, I fixed it by ending the table at the end of my code. Seconldy I changed the color on my snkae game backround by looking for where the code mentioned color and replaced the royalblue with red.
