## Memories and Learnings from Trimester 1

- Trimester one was full of ups and downs and plenty of chaos. This tirmester felt like it was split into three parts.

1. Downloading everything I need for the rest of year
    - this took forever but I began to understand the fundamentals of the terminal, github, and how my new tools will aid me this year.
2. Assembling Scrum team
    - This is where I leared aobut the value of working wiht a team in computer science, we all ran into porblems and with the collaboration of a team we were able to help ecah other and come up with questions to ask the teacher when we were stumped.
3. the Third step was doing actaul coding and learing the college board topics
    - This included doing and listening to the Team Teaches and learning about the college board topics.
